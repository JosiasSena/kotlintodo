# Kotlin ToDo application
My first full Kotlin application.

No architecture used, nothing fancy going on. Just actually building an entire Kotlin app from scratch for the first time, rather then just trying small stuff out on existing projects.

Uses realm for a local db, and firebase db for cloud
